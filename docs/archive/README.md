# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation from codebase assessments and planning exercises.

## Contents

- **EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md** - Quick codebase assessment summary from October 2025
- **CODEBASE-ASSESSMENT.md** - Comprehensive codebase quality assessment
- **WORK-PACKAGES.md** - Phased work packages for future improvements

## Why Archived?

These documents were created during a codebase assessment to evaluate quality and plan improvements. While valuable for historical reference and future planning, they are not needed for day-to-day development or deployment.

For current, practical documentation, see the parent [/docs](/docs) directory.

## When to Reference

- Planning major refactoring or feature additions
- Onboarding new contributors (if project scales)
- Reviewing project history and decision-making
- Understanding the rationale behind architectural choices
